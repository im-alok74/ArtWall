 * The Neon SQL client, created lazily.
 *
 * Lazy rather than module-scope so that importing this file during a build —
 * where `DATABASE_URL` may legitimately be absent — does not throw and break
 * prerendering. The error surfaces at call time, where a route can handle it.
 *
 * Neon's driver speaks HTTP, not TCP, so it works inside serverless and edge
 * runtimes where a traditional pooled `pg` connection cannot, and it needs no
 * connection lifecycle management on our side.
 *
 * `server-only` at the top of this file makes it a build error for any client
 * component to import it — the connection string can never leak into a browser
 * bundle by accident.
