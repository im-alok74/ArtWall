 * token. Anyone who views source can push arbitrary files into your account
 * until it is disabled. Signing costs one short server round-trip and means
 * only requests our server blessed will be accepted.
 *
 * Why direct-to-Cloudinary and not through our own route: a multi-megabyte
 * photo would otherwise occupy a serverless function for the whole upload,
 * burning execution time and hitting body-size limits. The browser talks to
 * Cloudinary; our server only ever handles a small JSON signature.
 *
 * No SDK dependency: the signature is a SHA-1 of sorted params plus the secret.
 * That is the entire algorithm, and `node:crypto` already ships it — pulling in
 * the SDK for this would be an unjustified dependency.
