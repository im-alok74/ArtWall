/**
 * The ArtWall mark, drawn to the brand's own reading of it:
 *
 *   THE WALL — two interlocking L-shapes forming an *open* frame. It is broken
 *              on purpose: an exhibition is an invitation, not an enclosure.
 *   THE LAB  — a sealed square. Closed because immutability is the point.
 *   THE SEED — the amber dot at the origin, where the artist begins.
 *   THE VOID — the overlap. Not emptiness; where creator meets collector.
 *
 * The open/closed contrast is the whole idea, so the wall is drawn as two L
 * strokes with a deliberate gap rather than as a rectangle — a closed wall
 * would say the opposite of what the brand means.
 *
 * Inline SVG rather than a raster asset: sharp at every size, inherits
 * `currentColor` so it works on light and dark surfaces, and costs no request.
