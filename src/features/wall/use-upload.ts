 * connection uploading a 12MB phone photo needs to see the bar move or they
 * will assume it hung and press the button again.
 *
 * The file never touches our server — the browser gets a short-lived signature
 * and posts straight to Cloudinary. That keeps a multi-megabyte body out of a
 * serverless function and off the request-size limit entirely.
