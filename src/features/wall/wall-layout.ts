 * The composition of the wall.

 * A uniform grid reads as a spreadsheet of thumbnails. A real gallery wall is
 * *justified*: rows of mixed portrait, square, and landscape work, each row
 * scaled so its edges line up while no two pieces are the same size. That is
 * what this computes — the arithmetic is separated from the rendering because
 * getting a justified row wrong by a pixel leaves visible gutters, and that is
 * far easier to reason about here than inside a component.
 *
 * Everything is deterministic. `Math.random` is unavailable to us anywhere in
 * this file: the server and the client must lay out byte-identical walls or
 * hydration mismatches, and a returning visitor must find their work where
 * they left it.
