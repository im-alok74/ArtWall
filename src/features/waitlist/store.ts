 * Persist a founding artist and return the place they were given.

 * rather than creating a duplicate or erroring. An artist who resubmits because
 * they were unsure it worked should be reassured, not punished — and their
 * place must not silently move.
 *
 * `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` (rather than `DO NOTHING`) is deliberate: it
 * makes the statement always return a row, so we never need a second round trip
 * to find out what number an existing artist holds.
 *
 * All values are passed as tagged-template parameters, so they are sent to
 * Postgres as bound parameters and cannot be interpolated into SQL text —
 * this is not string concatenation, and it is not vulnerable to injection.
